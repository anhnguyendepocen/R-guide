## Intro

**This is a focused quick reference guide to statistical programming in R.**

I learned R after completing my PhD in Nutritional Sciences in 2014, on my own time, for zero dollars, talking to zero humans. I benefitted from the great free resources provided by the R computing community, and have condensed those references in this guide. The guide is formatted as an R Markdown document.

The statistical information assumes foundational statistical knowledge that I gained in graduate school. I have provided links to my class notes where possible.

**This guide adds to the R literature in the following ways:**

- Integration and referencing of free resources
- Advanced information on linear models for experimental statistics
- Code examples
- R Markdown formatted document

I would like to share this resource broadly, and have made an effort to respect copyright restrictions of the various sources from which I have drawn.
